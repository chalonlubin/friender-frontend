## 🧐 Motivation & Challenges

> Friender was built as part of a 4 day sprint with @amaesanchez while attending Rithm School. Our major goal was to store images using AWS S3 buckets.
> Other than that, we wanted to build a tinder like application for friends, with a messaging system. We thought of other features as well, however with the limited time we were allotted and the required goals, we ended up just executing the basic requirements of storing and retrieving images with AWS S3 and having a swipe / match system.

> One challenging part was getting up to speed on how to exactly use AWS S3. We ended up leaning heavily on a YouTube tutorial, as the docs for this particular assignment we found unclear. Another challenge was budgeting time. We thought we could finish more features within the timeline, however we fell short of our goal in our estimations.
>
> Later on, I ended up transferring our AWS S3 to the 2023 version, and I also updated all dependencies. In the process I ended up transferring the entire app to utilize Vite instead of the outdated CRA.
